    "name": "Cornea Transplant",
    "description": "A cornea transplant is an operation to remove all or part of a damaged cornea and replace it with healthy donor tissue. A cornea transplant is often referred to as keratoplasty or a corneal graft. It can be used to improve sight, relieve pain and treat severe infection or damage. One of the most common reasons for a cornea transplant is a condition called keratoconus, which causes the cornea to change shape. The cornea is the clear outer layer at the front of the eyeball. It acts as a window to the eye. The cornea helps to focus light rays on to the retina. This picture is then transmitted to the brain. When the cornea is damaged, it can become less transparent or its shape can change. This can prevent light reaching the retina and causes the picture transmitted to the brain to be distorted or unclear."

    "name": "Retina Repair",
    "description": "Your retina is the part of your eye that sends images through your optic nerve to the brain. Your retina contains millions of cells that detect light like a camera. It is part of the very back of your eyeball and is essential to your vision. Retinal detachment occurs when the retina pulls away from the back of the eye and the blood supply. Without a blood supply, the retinal cells will start to die. This can cause permanent damage to your vision. If the macula completely detaches, you may lose your vision entirely. There are several types of surgery to repair a detached retina. A simple tear in the retina can be treated with freezing, called cryotherapy, or a laser procedure. Different types of retinal detachment require different kinds of surgery and different levels of anesthesia. The type of procedure your doctor preforms will depend on the severity of retinal detachment."

    "description": "Glaucoma is a chronic disease that sometimes may be difficult to establish de exact time of origin of the disease, especially when patients may show incomplete clinical pictures or even appear normal. Glaucoma is the most common optic neuropathy in the adulthood. Glaucoma is defined as an optic neuropathy associated in most cases with elevated intraocular pressure, with or without anatomic predisposing factors in the anterior chamber. There has been emphasis on glaucoma screening, since most of the times there is an insidious start of the disease, and progression may be slow and unnoticed to the patient. The purpose of glaucoma screening tests is to detect those with early stage disease, so that these patients can be treated to reduce the risk of visual field loss."
